# Movie-Tier-List-App

A Movie Tier List App created by Group 1 for our senior capstone project. Users can sign in, add movies to their watchlist, create multiple tier lists, and rank movies from their watchlist to a tier list of their choice using Drag-and-Drop features. 

This project aimed to create a website that allows you to create an account and through this account you can have multiple different movie tier lists with hundreds of movies from the TMDB database. Here we leveraged Django/Python, HTML/CSS, Postgres/PGAdmin4, Nginx and Docker to bring this project to life.
